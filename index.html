      <p>
        This document captures common practices in designing APIs that fit well into the Web platform as
        a whole, using WebIDL [[!WEBIDL]].
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
        This document has been developed progressively over time with help from the WebApps WG
        and the ScriptLib CG.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Over a relatively short period of time the number of different APIs being created for use on the
        Web has grown at a sustained pace. In working on these interfaces, many in the community discuss
        the benefits of certain approaches over others and reach agreement as to the preferred solution when
        facing a given problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping track of all these gems is however difficult given the volume of work being carried on
        in parallel and the sometimes disjointed nature of the groups involved. As a result, it can take
        a long while and many arguments repeated almost identically before a good solution becomes common.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's more, it is altogether too rare to garner feedback from developers who are actually using
        these features in their day-to-day work. Because of this, several APIs have shipped with issues
        that could have been caught earlier on in the process. This document therefore also endeavours
        to elicit feedback from developers in order to make it more readily available to API designers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this document is to capture such ideas as they appear and accrete them over time so as
        to constitute a repository of knowledge on this topic. As a guide it does not however attempt to
        supplant editors' brains in making decisions as to how to design their APIs, and consequently one
        must keep in mind that the reasoning behind a specific recommendation is often more important than
        its result. Furthermore, in some cases there may not be a single consensual best approach, and
        editors will need to understand the tradeoffs involved in order to pick what works for them amongst
        a set of options.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Basics</h2>
      <p>
        This section covers the very basics of API creation for the Web platform. If you are familiar with
        the APIs found there, you might wish to simply skim the titles.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Casing</h2>
        <p>
          Casing is relatively coherent across the platform, and if you are familiar with JavaScript development
          it should come to you rather naturally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interfaces, dictionaries, exceptions, and callbacks all use “CamelCase”. That is to say no underscores are used
          and the first letter of every word is in uppercase. The rules when one of those words is an acronym
          are not necessarily well established — follow your instinct (or try to avoid acronyms).
        </p>
        <pre class='example'>
          FascinatingDocument
          Node
          SomethingBadHappened
          XMLHttpRequest
        </pre>
        <p>
          Both attributes and methods use “pascalCase” also known as “interCaps”. Which is to say that the first
          letter is lowercase, no underscores are used, and all the following logical words in the name
          start with an uppercase letter.
        </p>
        <pre class='example'>
          obj.thisIsAnAttribute
          obj.simple
          obj.doSomethingNow()
          obj.run()
        </pre>
        <p>
          Constants are all uppercase, with logical words separated by underscores. Families of constants tend
          to have common suffixes. Please note that constants are decreasingly used and that it is likely you 
          will not be having recourse to this construct very much (see <a href='#numerical-constants'>Don't 
          Use Numerical Constants</a>).
        </p>
        <pre class='example'>
          REALLY_STUPID_ERROR
          PASTA_SAUCE_TYPE
        </pre>
        <p>
          Events are a bit special and for historical reasons have somewhat more convoluted rules. The interface 
          that represents a specific event will follow the general rules for interfaces, ending with <code>Event</code>. 
          But the event name will be all lowercase and with no underscores. Likewise, the <code>on*</code> event 
          attribute will be the event name (all lowercase and glued together) simply prefixed with “<code>on</code>”.
        </p>
        <pre class='example'>
          SomethingHappenedEvent
          obj.addEventListener("somethinghappened", handler, false);
          el.onsomethinghappened = handler;
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Using attributes</h2>
        <p>
          It is not always obvious when one should use an attribute rather than a method. The basic rule is simple:
          use attributes as often as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Never use <code>getFoo()</code>/<code>setFoo()</code> accessor pairs unless it is very clear that these are
          operations that have strong effects beyond just changing the property of the object. If you wish your interface
          to also be usable in a language other than JavaScript and for which such accessors tend to be needed, the bindings
          for that language can naturally generate the accessor pair. Don't do this:
        </p>
        <pre class='illegal-example' title='Bad usage'>
          var len = obj.getLength();
          arr.setLength(num);
        </pre>
        <p>
          But rather:
        </p>
        <pre class='example'>
          var len = obj.length;
          arr.length = num;
        </pre>
        <p>
          Beyond operations that obviously require a method (that take parameters, return a computed value, carry out
          an action, etc.) there are specific cases in which what might at first seem like a candidate for being
          an attribute is best handled as a method:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Modifies the value</dt>
          <dd>
            In some cases there may be relations between objects such that when one is set as the value of another
            it needs to be updated to reflect its end of the relationship as well. For instance, when setting
            <code class='highlight'>objA.child = objB</code> it may be necessary to set <code>objB.parent</code>
            to <code>objA</code> behind the scenes. Such side effects call for a method: <code>objA.setChild(objB)</code>.
          </dd>
          <dt>Asynchronous access</dt>
          <dd>
            In some instances, an object may be available but it is best if some of its fields are only loaded 
            lazily because they require time to compute. The canonical example is the size of a file. If processing
            objects representing files, making the size of each file available immediately will be costly, and 
            acquiring it synchronously upon attribute access would lead to poor performance (those <code>stat</code>
            calls are not cheap). In such cases it is best to make the accessor an asynchronous method that is
            passed a callback such as <code class='highlight'>someFile.size(function (bytes) { … })</code> 
            (or, if there are many such properties on the object, have a single call to load them all, for instance
            <code class='highlight'>someFile.stat(function (info) { … })</code>).
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>When To Be Asynchronous</h2>
        <p>
          The Web platform's runtime model is based on a single-threaded event loop. Because of that, any time
          a method requires even a little bit of time to run, it blocks the thread, and therefore the execution
          of anything else on the page — leading to bad user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example of operations that can take a while to complete include reading from the network, accessing the
          disk, performing a database search, or waking a sensor up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another case in which asynchronous operations are required is for all security entry points. Some operations
          (e.g. obtaining the device's physical location) can require the user agent to obtain the user's permission.
          If that were to be done synchronously, the entire application would freeze while the user makes her decision.
          This is undesirable in terms of user experience, but it also a bad security model. The user needs to have
          all the time she wants in order to make such decisions and should not feel pressured by a frozen application
          (people make bad security decisions when they want to get something done).
        </p>
        <p>
          It can seem tempting to make methods either synchronous or asynchronous at the developer's discretion.
          The simple answer to that is: don't. The result can be catastrophic: for instance, while in development 
          a method that has to interact with a remote resource may return quickly because of light load on the 
          server and proximity between the developer (who is using a powerful device on a fast network) and the 
          server, so that the synchronous call may seem fine. But once deployed, it can cause long, very 
          perceivable freezes for the end-users. The <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> interface does make that option
          available on its <code>open()</code> method and there is broad consensus that it was a bad decision that
          should never be emulated.
        </p>
        <p>
          A context that is not similarly affected by synchronous issues is that of Web Workers (since they run in a 
          separate conceptual thread from the Web application's user interface). In such cases, it can sometimes be useful to
          provide a synchronous variant of an asynchronous interface that would be available solely in a Worker context.
          This is primarily done in order to make development simpler in such contexts and should not be considered 
          required.

        <h2>Don't Use Numerical Constants</h2>
        <p>
          Interfaces regularly require constant identifiers. You have a node and you want to know if it's
          an element or a comment. You have a message and you want to know if it's email or SMS. That much makes
          sense. What does not make sense is insisting on naming these things with numbers when we could name them
          with, you know, names.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several variants in this bad practice. First, is the lovingly terse approach:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          if (foo.type === 17) doSomething();
        </pre>
        <p>
          Then there is the comment you have to paste every time:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          // check if this of the fungible type
          if (foo.type === 17) doSomething();
        </pre>
        <p>
          Or we can have the uselessly long variant:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          if (foo.type === FooInterface.FUNGIBLE_TYPE) doSomething();
        </pre>
        <p>
          And there's the meh option:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          var isFungible = FooInterface.FUNGIBLE_TYPE;
          // ...
          if (foo.type === isFungible) doSomething();
        </pre>
        <p>
          None of the above is as simple, terse, and self-documenting as:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          if (foo.type === "fungible") doSomething();
        </pre>
        <p>
          We're not in the 1970s, standardising UNIX system calls. Strings are lightweight enough,
          and readable. There is no need to define string constants to support these: just the plain
          strings, defined as such in specification prose, work. In some languages, this can lose
          static verification, but in JavaScript it makes no difference: if you misspell the the
          string you might have equally misspelt the constant, with the same failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, interfaces that don't start out by listing a dozen (useless) constants are
          more readable. The only downside to doing away with numerical constants is the negative
          impact it may on occasion have on feature detection. It would however be better to rely
          on other aspects that enable feature detection, since these constants can easily be added
          for a half-baked feature (and frequently have been).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Namespacing and Prefixing</h2>
        <p>
          If you are developing functionality for use inside of a Web runtime (but not a browser) that is likely to
          both share code with existing Web projects (typically, libraries like jQuery) and that also plans to
          evolve and integrate improvements to the Web platform on a regular basis, then you should make sure
          that the interfaces and methods you add cannot conflict with ones added to the core platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          For methods and attributes that extend existing interfaces, you should rely on vendor prefixing, i.e. simply
          prefixing your additions with a short string that is your company's or project's name.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          xhr.acmePassiveFTP();
          document.acmeDigitalSignature;
        </pre>
        <p>
          For interfaces that you add, rather than prefixing all of their names which can get tedious, it can
          be simpler to just make them available under your own namespaced object.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          var toaster = new acme.Toaster();
        </pre>
      </section>

      <h2>WebIDL Constructs</h2>
      <p>
        WebIDL [[WEBIDL]] is a powerful and flexible schema language for APIs. It is a useful foundation in
        ensuring that APIs can be defined interoperably without each and everyone of them needing to repeat
        all manners of behavioural specifics.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can however be somewhat daunting to use at times, and the intricacies of the platform mean that
        it has some dark or at least non-obvious corners. This chapter endeavours to help clarify at least
        enough of it that you will feel comfortable making use of it.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2 id='dictionaries'>Using Dictionaries</h2>
        <p>
          While designing Web APIs, you might encounter situations where you need to define an interface 
          that has no method. That is, for certain requirements, you need a method to define a property 
          bag object that would be expressed as an <code>Object</code> object or as an object literal in 
          JavaScript implementation. This is where the dictionaries come into play.
        </p>
        <p>
          This section presents a guideline to use dictionaries at the right place in your specification 
          without any common mistake. First, in the "When to use" section, we show the typical cases you can 
          make use of dictionaries. Second, in the "How to use" section, we provide a list of features that you
          can check in order not to make a common mistake with dictionary usage.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2>When to use</h2>
          <p>
            Property bag objects are commonly used to define optional parameters for certain
            methods of given interfaces. Also, they can be used to define necessary data
            structures and data formats in a given application context. Here are the 
            representative examples:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Case 1: Arguments to Interface Method</strong>
            When designing interfaces using WebIDL, you can use dictionaries to define a
            property bag object that carries multiple arguments to its method. In many 
            practices, the methods take dictionary value as an optional argument
            although it is not mandatory.
          </p>
          <pre class='example highlight'>
            // WebIDL
            partial interface IDBDatabaseSync {
                IDBObjectStoreSync createObjectStore (DOMString name, 
                                                      optional IDBObjectStoreParameters optionalParameters);
            };

            dictionary IDBObjectStoreParameters {
                DOMString? keyPath = null;
                boolean autoIncrement = false;
            };

            // JavaScript
            var parameters = {
                keyPath: "id"
            ,   autoIncrement: true
            };
            trans.db.createObjectStore("Contact", parameters);
          </pre>

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Case 2: Arguments to Constructor</strong>
            Using dictionaries, you can also define a constructor arguments to the given
            interfaces. This allows the developers create and pass an object or an
            object literal to the constructor of the JavaScript objects.
          </p>

            <strong>Case 3: User object</strong>
            A dictionary is normatively defined as an associative array data type with a
            fixed, ordered set of key-value pairs. That is, you can use a
            dictionary to define a custom data type carrying a set of properties as an 
            object format used in the given application context.

          <h2>How to use</h2>
          <section>
            <h2>Use sequence type</h2>
            <p>
              Dictionaries are always passed by value. Hence, when you define a dictionary 
              member that should carry an array of certain value, use sequence type rather 
              than Array type. Sequences are always passed by value while arrays are
              passed by reference.
            </p>
            <pre class='example'>
              dictionary IntentParameters {
                  DOMString              action;
                  DOMString              type;
                  any                    data;
                  sequence&lt;Transferable> transfer;
                  Object                 extras;
                  URL                    service;
                  sequence&lt;URL>         suggestions;
              };
            </pre>
            <p>
              In addition, there is another check point where sequence type should be used 
              rather than array type. WebIDL describes that the dictionary 
              type must not be used as a type of element of an array. Hence, when your 
              dictionary has to carry an array of the dictionary values as its member,
              use sequence type.
            </p>

              dictionary DoNotUseLikeThis {

            <h2>Inheritance</h2>

              Dictionaries support inheritance as interface does. A dictionary must not 
              be defined having a cycle in its hierarchy.
            </p>
            <pre class='example'>
              dictionary Novel : Book {

            <h2>Optional Dictionary Member and Defaulting Values</h2>
            <p>
              On a given dictionary value, the presence of each dictionary member is
              optional. Therefore, in order to indicate that certain members are required fields in
              your specification, use default values. Dictionary members with default values
              are always considered to be present.
            </p>
            <pre class='example'>
              dictionary PropertyBag {
                  DOMString iAmRequired = "default";
                  DOMString iAmOptional;
              };
            </pre>
            <p>
              In the example, since <code>iAmRequired</code> has default value, it is always
              considered as present when the dictionary value is passed. On the other hand, when
              <code>iAmOptional</code> is missing, it is regarded as absent.

            <h2>Attribute, Constant, or Exception fields</h2>
            <p>
              It is one of common mistakes that a dictionary type is used with attribute
              field in interface definition. In face, dictionaries must not be used as the type
              of attribute, constant or exception fields.
            </p>
            <pre class='example'>
              interface HasWrongUsage {
                  readonly attribute IAmDictionary dict;
              };
            </pre>
            <p>
              To correct it, use type any or object and describe in prose that the
              attribute takes the type of the dictionary.
            </p>
            <pre class='example'>
              interface HasRightUsage {
                  readonly attribute any dict;
              };
            </pre>
            <p>
              In your spec, write "dict is of type IAmDictionary dictionary as defined in
              [REFERENCE]".

            <h2>No Nullable Dictionary</h2>
            <p>
              Do not use dictionary type as inner type of a nullable type. By definition in WebIDL dictionary, 
              valued with <code>null</code>, is regarded to be an empty dictionary, which is not <code>null</code>.
              (It can even have the value of members defined in their default values.)
            </p>
            <pre class='example'>
              dictionary HasWrongUsage {
                  IAmDictionary? dict;

              };
            </pre>
            <p>
              As members of a dictionary are optional by definition, the developer who
              reads your specification can omit the member that she intends to be not present in
              the given application context.

        <h2>Interfaces</h2>
        <p>
          Interfaces are the core work horse of WebIDL as they are the means through which functionality is
          exposed. They are introduced with the <code>interface</code> keyword, have a name, and a body that
          contains their definition in terms of constants, attributes, and methods (known as “operations” in 
          WebIDL). A typical interface looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          interface BeerBottle {
              // body goes here
          };
        </pre>
        <p>
          Without modifiers, an interface will become available in the global context as an object with the
          same name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interfaces can inherit from other interfaces, in which case they acquire their properties. Inheritance
          is specified like this:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          interface BeerBottle : Bottle {
              // body
          };
          interface Spork : Spoon, Fork {
              // body
          };
        </pre>
        <p>
          As in the last example above, an interface can inherit from any number of other interfaces. This practice
          however is discouraged if it can be avoided as it entails more complex resolution rules and can be
          difficult to implement in some contexts. Multiple inheritance is often a sign that the API design should
          be revisited and can be simplified.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2>Partial Interfaces</h2>
          <p>
            It is common to have to add functionality to an existing interface, or to wish to define a single
            interface spread over multiple locations. This can happen primarily for two reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The interface may be defined in another specification and extended by a new one. This is a
              relatively common pattern for core interfaces off which things may be attached (e.g.
              <code>Navigator</code>). It's an important aspect of the Web platform's core extensibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some editors occasionally consider it useful to split the definition of an interface into
              smaller pieces as part of the same document. This is sometimes done to make the specification
              clearer (though the advantages here are debatable), or sometimes because part of the interface
              is optional.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In both cases there is a need to extend an existing interface, and inheritance is not the solution
            since one effectively wishes to mix functionality into the existing interface, and not create a
            new one.
          </p>
          <p>
            A construct that was previously used for this <em>but is no longer recommended</em> was
            to create the extending interface with <code>[NoInterfaceObject]</code> and then state
            that the existing interface <code>implements</code> the extending one. This is
            exemplified below:
          </p>
          <pre class='illegal-example highlight'>
            // we wish to add findUnicorns() to Navigator
            [NoInterfaceObject]
            interface UnicornNavigator {
                Unicorns findUnicorns (DOMString name);
            };
            Navigator implements UnicornNavigator;
            // you can now call navigator.findUnicorns("tab");
          </pre>
          <p>
            This is clunky however, and no longer necessary. It can still be found in some drafts but should
            not be copied.
          </p>
          <p>
            The proper way of implementing this feature is to use <code>partial</code> interfaces. These
            are just like regular interfaces, except that they are defined to specify simply a fragment of
            the whole, and can therefore add to existing interfaces that may be defined anywhere else.
          </p>
          <p>
            The previous example can therefore best be rewritten as:
          </p>
          <pre class='example highlight'>
            partial interface Navigator {
                Unicorns findUnicorns (DOMString name);
            };
          </pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>[Constructor] and [NamedConstructor]</h2>
          <p>
            If you have read WebIDL as found in many specifications, you will have noticed that there are
            special constructs that can decorate existing ones in order to enhance them. These are called
            “extended attributes” and their goal is not to change the WebIDL itself — which is to say that
            they don't modify the abstract schema described by WebIDL — but to influence how the concrete
            language bindings operate.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this section we look at several extended attributes that have a bearing on how interfaces
            are bound in JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            By default, when an interface is bound in JavaScript, an interface object for it is available
            globally but it is not constructible. That is to say that it can be used for instance for
            <code>instanceof</code> testing, or that it can expose some members such as static methods,
            static attributes, or constants but you can't construct it with <code>new</code>. Try out
            for instance in your JavaScript console:
          </p>
          <pre class='example highlight'>
            new Node()
            // TypeError: Node is not a constructor
          </pre>
          <p>
            Therefore, in order to use a constructor in JavaScript, you will need to use the <code>[Constructor]</code>
            extended attribute. <code>[Constructor]</code> can optionally take parameters (not giving it parentheses is
            the same as giving it an empty set) and you can specify multiple ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            An example might make this clearer:
          </p>
          <pre class='example highlight'>
            // new Unicorn();
            [Constructor]       // the same as [Constructor()]
            interface Unicorn {
                // ...
            };
            
            // new Unicorn();
            // new Unicorn("tab");
            // new Unicorn(5, 82);
            [Constructor,
             Constructor(DOMString name),
             Constructor(unsigned long wingspan, unsigned long age)]
            interface Unicorn {
                // ...
            };
          </pre>
          <p>
            At times it is desirable to have the constructor for an interface have a different name from that
            of the interface. For such cases, use the <code>[NamedConstructor]</code> extended attribute. It
            works in the exact same way as <code>[Constructor]</code>, except that it also accepts an identifier
            that specifies the name to use for the constructor. An example will show the syntax:
          </p>
          <pre class='example highlight'>
            // new Rose();
            // new Rose("pink");
            [NamedConstructor=Rose,
             NamedConstructor=Rose(DOMString colour)]
            interface RosoideaeRosa {
                // ...
            };
          </pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>[ArrayClass]</h2>
          <p>
            Another useful extended attribute for interfaces is <code>[ArrayClass]</code>. It comes in handy when
            it is necessary to define an interface that can behave just like a real JavaScript array. It is meant
            to be used with the <code>getter</code>, <code>setter</code>, <code>creator</code>, and <code>deleter</code> 
            keywords for indexed properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            These keywords are rather straightforward:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The <code>getter</code> defines what happens when a value is fetched from the array, so that for instance 
              the following can work: <code class='highlight'>var carrots = shoppingList[7];</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <code>setter</code> and <code>creator</code> is the reverse and defines what happens when a value is 
              set in the array (on an existing entry or a newly minted one — for arrays you usually want to use the
              same operation for <code>setter</code> and <code>creator</code>), for instance with the following: 
              <code class='highlight'>shoppingList[0] = "beer";</code> or 
              <code class='highlight'>shoppingList.push("unicorns");</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, the <code>deleter</code> defines what happens when a value is removed from the array, for instance 
              with: <code class='highlight'>shoppingList.pop();</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Assembling this all together looks like this:
          </p>
          <pre class='example highlight'>
            [ArrayClass]
            interface ShoppingList {
                attribute unsigned long length;
                getter object getShoppingItem (unsigned long index);
                // note how both creator and setter are used here
                creator setter object setShoppingItem (unsigned long index, object item);
                deleter void removeShoppingItem (unsigned long index);
            };
          </pre>
          <p>
            The above give you a <code>ShoppingList</code> interface. You could use it as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class='example highlight'>
            var list = obj.findShoppingListFor("robin");
            list = list.concat("beer tea basil ham cat-food".split(" "));
            list.forEach(function (item) {
                remindUser("Shop for " + item);
            });
            list.pop(); // bad cat
            console.log("Getting " + list.join("\n"));
          </pre>

          <h2>When to use [NoInterfaceObject]</h2>
          <p>
            There have been many excessive uses of <code>[NoInterfaceObject]</code> — unless you are absolutely
            certain that it is what you want, you should avoid it. The odds are good that what you are looking
            for is either a <a href='#partial-interfaces'>partial interface</a> or a <a href='#dictionaries'>dictionary</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice it should only be used for abstract interfaces that enrich a concrete one through the
            <code>implements</code> statement.

        <h2>Constants</h2>
        <p>
          Constants are a simple construct that does exactly what it say on the tin. It creates a member of a given type on
          an interface (or an exception) the value of which cannot be changed, introduced with the <code>const</code>
          keyword.
        </p>
        <p>
          Constants are limited in the values they can accept. They can take numerical values (including the likes of
          <code>Infinity</code> and <code>NaN</code>), booleans, or <code>null</code> (for cases in which you might forget
          what the value of <code>null</code> is). Examples tell you all you need to know about the syntax:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          interface Something {
              const short ANSWER = 42;
              const boolean WRONG = false;
              const unsigned long BIG_NUMBER = Infinity;
          };
        </pre>
        <p>
          While they were previously used rather commonly, there are decreasing reasons to want to resort to
          constants on interfaces. Before using them, be sure to be aware of <a href='#enums'>Enums</a> and
          <a href='#numerical-constants'>Don't Use Numerical Constants</a>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Enums</h2>
        <p>
          An enumeration is used to specify a set of strings that are acceptable, it is typically used
          to define options that are restricted to a limited vocabulary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enumerations are defined with the <code>enum</code> keyword, a type name, and then a list of
          strings (with no duplicates) inside curly brackets. The name can then be used where type
          identifiers usually appear.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          enum Unit {
              "m",
              "cm",
              "mm"
          };
          interface Unicorn {
              void setHornSize (unsigned long length, Unit unit);
          };
          // This works
          //    unicorn.setHornSize(42, "cm");
          // This blows up as well it should
          //    unicorn.setHornSize(7, "in");
        </pre>
        <p>
          When an attribute is defined to be an enumeration type, then assigning a value to it that is
          not in the enumerated set simply does nothing.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <p>
          Attributes are a fundamental building block of interfaces. They are used to specify data fields of
          a given type. An attribute is introduced with the <code>attribute</code> keyword.
        </p>
        <p>
          They can be read-only in which case they cannot be assigned to, or read-write. It is important to
          note that if the value of a read-only attribute is not atomic but has attributes of its own, those
          are not made read-only as well — they keep operating just as specified by that type. An example:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          interface Name {
              attribute DOMString givenName;
              attribute DOMString familyName;
          };
          interface Person {
              readonly attribute Name fullName;
          };
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the above definition, it is impossible to assign a new value of the <code>fullName</code> field
          of <code>Person</code>. So you could not do the following: <code>billie.name = someName;</code>.
          But the fields of the <code>Name</code> object itself stay just as re-write so that they can still
          be set, as in <code>billie.name.familyName = "The Cat";</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An attribute can also be said to be <code>static</code>, in which case it is an attribute of the
          interface rather than being associated with the object. Static attributes are rarely good ideas
          and can tend to indicate a bad design.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          // set the debug flag globally
          interface Runtime {
              static attribute boolean debug;
          };
        </pre>
        <p>
          A specific behaviour can be added to attributes to define how a given object is turned into a string,
          using the <code>stringifier</code> modifier. When a object is cast to a string, if a <code>stringifier</code>
          has been specified (there can be only one) then the string produced will be the value of that 
          attribute. Naturally, that attribute has to be of type <code>DOMString</code>.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          // another Person interface
          [Constructor(DOMString name, short age)]
          interface Unicorn {
              stringifier attribute DOMString fullName;
              attribute short age;
          };
        </pre>
        <p>
          This can then be used with the following code:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          var uni = new Unicorn("Tab", 42);
          document.getElementById("output-unicorn").textContent = uni;
          // that element now has content "Tab";
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>
          Methods are the workhorses of WebIDL. In the specification they are known as “operations”, but
          since everyone calls them methods we have decided to stick to this term as it will be more readily
          understood. They are used to define behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Methods have a return type, and a list of arguments which can be precisely specified. As for attributes,
          a method can also be said to be <code>static</code>, in which case they become available on the
          interface object directly.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          interface KittenFactory {
              static Kitten makeMeANewKitten (DOMString name);
          };
          // var billie = KittenFactory.makeMeANewKitten("Billie The Cat");
        </pre>
        <p>
          The return type can be any type or <code>void</code>, which indicates that nothing is returned.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most complex part of a method's definition is its arguments list. It can contain any number of
          argument definitions, each of which has a type and a name; all of them separated by commas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that it used to be that arguments were all preceded by the <code>in</code> keyword, which was
          a leftover from OMG IDL. Since Web specifications make no use of the <code>out</code> and <code>inout</code>
          argument styles of the aptly named OMG specification, the <code>in</code> keyword has been dropped and
          must not be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          A basic method therefore looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          interface Unicorn {
              void gallop (unsigned long speed, Pattern rhythm);
              AudioStream speak ();
          };
        </pre>
        <p>
          The arguments can be modified in a number of ways. First, an argument can be marked as
          <code>optional</code> in which case it can be omitted when the method is invoked. If so, 
          it should be noted that all the arguments that are positioned after it in the list will 
          also be considered optional.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          enum Direction { "left", "right" };
          interface Dahut {
              void turnAround (optional Direction whichWay, short degrees);
          };
          // I can call someDahut.turnAround()
        </pre>
        <p>
          Note that in the above it is not indicated that the <code>degrees</code> argument is optional even
          though it implicitly is. For readability purposes, it is best to always indicate that an argument
          is optional even when it implicitly is as someone scanning the method definition quickly from the
          end might not notice it.
        </p>
        <p>
          A problem with the above method definition is also that while my dahut can only turn left or
          right, there is no indication of what happens if I omit the argument. Is it right or left? Or
          random? This can be remedied in specification prose but it is better to specify a default
          directly in the WebIDL, as follows:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          enum Direction { "left", "right" };
          interface Dahut {
              void turnAround (optional Direction whichWay = "left", short degrees);
          };
          // when I call someDahut.turnAround(), it now turns left
        </pre>
        <p>
          An argument can also be <em>variadic</em>. This indicates that that argument can be repeated zero or
          more times when the method is called. This can only be done if it is the last argument in the arguments
          list. Variadic arguments are specified by appending "<code>...</code>" to the type.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          interface Restaurant {
              DeferredFood orderFood (DOMString... dishName);
          };
          // I can now call
          //  resto.orderFood("spam", "spam", "spam", "spam", "spam", "spam", "spam", "spam", "spam");
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Overloading and Union Types</h2>
        <p>
          WebIDL makes it possible to use overloading of methods in interfaces so that there can be
          more than one method with a given name that takes a different set of arguments. This happens
          simply by specifying the method more than once.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that method overloading is rarely needed and should usually be avoided unless there is
          no better solution, if only because the restrictions on how it can be used and the resolution
          rules can be quite complex. A lot of the cases in which one may think that overloading may
          be required are actually better addressed with optional arguments, variadic arguments,
          or at times union types.
        </p>
        <p>
          Union types are used where types can be used, but instead of specifying just one type they
          indicated that the values can be of several different types. They are specified between parentheses,
          with each type separated by the <code>or</code> keyword.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          interface Party {
              void bookDate ((Date or unsigned long or DOMString) date);
          };
          // I can now call with...
          //  a JS Date object
          //    party.bookDate(new Date(…));
          //  time since epoch
          //    party.bookDate(1337998907987);
          //  a magic string
          //    party.bookDate("tomorrow");
        </pre>
        <p>
          This can be useful for return values as well:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          interface Cryptozoology {
              (Dahut or Unicorn) findAnimal ();
          };
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Exceptions</h2>
        <p>
          Exceptions are special classes that can be used to be thrown. They are very limited interfaces
          that can only define constants, and a limited kind of attribute (known as “fields”) that are
          defined solely by a type and a name.
        </p>
        <p>
          All exceptions automatically get a <code>message</code> and a <code>name</code> field (for which
          the specification should provide values), such that those need not be explicitly specified.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is <strong>strongly</strong> recommended that new specifications do <strong>not</strong> define
          new exceptions, but rather reuse <code>DOMException</code> while providing a specific <code>name</code>
          for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to <code>DOMException</code>, a number of predefined exceptions are also available that 
          can be reused by specifications. This list is: <code>Error</code>, <code>EvalError</code>, <code>RangeError</code>, 
          <code>ReferenceError</code>, <code>SyntaxError</code>, <code>TypeError</code> and <code>URIError</code>
          (these correspond to their JavaScript equivalents as defined in [[ECMA-262]]).
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to these constraints on usage, we have decided not to delve deeply into exceptions in this
          section.

        <h2>Callbacks</h2>
        <p>
          It is very common for asynchronous methods in Web APIs to accept callbacks, which are functions
          that can be called with specific arguments when called back. These are specified with the
          <code>callback</code> keyword, a name, a return type, and an arguments list which is similar
          to that used for a method.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifying callbacks is simple:
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          // defining callbacks
          callback LandingOk = void (unsigned long landingSpeed);
          callback LandingFail = void (DOMString gravity, short casualties);
          
          // using callbacks
          interface FlyingUnicorn {
              void land (LandingOk, LandingFail);
          };
          
          // in code
          myFlyingUnicorn.land(
                  function (speed) {
                      console.log("Successfully landed at " + speed + "kph!");
                  }
              ,   function (severity, dead) {
                      console.log("Crashed landing. Damage level: " + severity + ". Dead elves: " + dead);
                  }

        <h2>Specifying Callbacks</h2>
        <p>
          Asynchronous method calls require a point of reentry in the form of a callback. There are multiple
          ways of specifying these, none of which is consensually consider the one and only approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          One is <dfn>success/error callback functions</dfn>, as used in [[GEOLOCATION-API]]. It takes the shape of a method
          call that accepts a callback function for success followed by one for errors. There may be arguments
          before the success callback, and the error callback is usually optional.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          navigator.petKitten(
              function() {
                  console.log("kitten is purring");
              },
              function(err) {
                  console.log("kitten hates you, because: " + err);
              }
          );
        </pre>
        <p>
          Downsides of this approach are that it is a little more verbose and does not encourage error handling. It
          also lacks in extensibility since adding new arguments to the method will typically require placing them
          after the optional error handler — making them de facto optional. Likewise, extending it to support not
          just callbacks for success and error but also for other situations that may warrant reporting information
          back (e.g. progress being made) is clumsy at best. Since it is only used in [[GEOLOCATION-API]] it does not
          appear to be a required pattern for consistency.
        </p>
        <p>Another approach is to define new DOM Events that are called when an underlying system changes.</p>
        <pre class='example higlight'>
          window.addEventListener("kittenpurr", function() {
              console.log("kitten is purring");
          }, false);
        </pre>
        <p>On one hand, most developers are quite familiar with DOM Events, and they make it easy to have several handlers for a given event.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, using DOM Events for listening to systems that need specific activation (e.g. powering up) are usually not a good idea: <code>addEventListener</code> is supposed to be free from side effects, and associating activation code with it breaks that promise. The [[DEVICE-ORIENTATION]] specification is as such an <strong>anti-pattern</strong> that should not be replicated. See <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/2011Nov/0164.html">some discussions on side effects in addEventListener</a>.</p>
        <p>
          Another is <dfn>returning an EventTarget object</dfn>, as pioneered by [[XMLHTTPREQUEST]]. This consists
          in opening a request that returns an object on which event handlers can be registered, then starting
          that request with a specific call.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          var kitpet = navigator.openKittenPetting();

          kitpet.onpurr = function () {
              console.log("kitten is purring");
          };

          kitpet.ondrool = function () {
              console.log("kitten is now drooling");
          };

          kitpet.onviciousbite = function () {
              console.log("kitten bit your hand off");
          };

          kitpet.start();
        </pre>
        <p>
          The approach is the most verbose and does not encourage error handling, but it does have the advantages
          of being trivially extended for greater feedback, and of being familiar to users of [[XMLHTTPREQUEST]]
          (and now [[INDEXEDDB]]). It can, however, feel rather overkill if extensions for additional events does
          not seem likely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there are <dfn>NodeJS style callbacks</dfn>. For every asynchronous operation, every callback takes
          as first parameter an error object which is <code>null</code> when the operation was a success, followed
          by as many pieces of information as are needed to capture the success.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          navigator.petKitten(function (err, state) {
              if (err) console.log("kitten mauled your face with extreme prejudice");
              else console.log("kittem manifest joy by " + state);
          });
        </pre>
        <p>
          The primary value in this approach is that it puts errors "right there" where they are likely to be handled.
          Its consistency is also very helpful in creating chains of callbacks, a feature that proves precious
          when multiple callbacks can become nested. The major downside of this approach is that it is currently
          not used in the rest of stack and therefore probably only familiar to NodeJS developers (which granted
          represent a fast-growing proportion of the general web developer population).
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally there are <dfn>promises</dfn>. These are similar to <a>returning an EventTarget object</a> but
          more generic and use a slightly different style.
        </p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>
          var promise = navigator.petKitten();
          promise.then(function () {
              console.log("kitten is purring");
          }).fail(function () {
              console.log("kitten bit your hand off");
          }).run();
        </pre>
        <p>
          There is elegance and flexibility in promises, but to date they are used in no Web specification.

        Anne maintains a document called <a href='http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Howto_spec'>How To Spec</a> on 
        how to specify certain features of the platform. Some parts of it are tailored to the specific markup
        that is used when processing specifications with Anolis, but the general advice is sound.
